1. Generate covariates (X) and outcome (Y). X can be time/spatial varying, beta should be only time-varying
2. Plot Y vs X stratified by time
3. Do linear regression of Y on X and see inferential results


# 23/11/20
1. Potential unidentifiability issue: try not use the same covariates in fixed and random effects

# 23/12/7
1. Moving average simulation

# 23/12/14
1. Add time-varying temporal effect to the mean process
2. Generate a second outcome and calculate correlation:
Y_i2(s,t) = 2t * Y_i1(s,t) + b_i(s,t) + error
3. Get a 100-subject example?
